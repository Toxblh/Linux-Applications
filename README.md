# 🐧 Linux Applications
My pack of applications which I use on Linux

Small history part. From 2014 I use macOS as home and work station, in parallel was Windows station for games and surfing the internet. After building a new PC I install Windows for games and install Linux distro as the second system for work. So at home Linux stay my main OS, and at work I still use macOS. And now I in progress to create the best pack of apps for work and life on Linux. The pack will be to update as I will found the best solutions.
